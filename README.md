# Employee_attrition_project
Employee Attrition detection.

~Developed an employee attrition risk prediction solution using employee survey and historical HR data, observing an overall attrition rate of ~22.5%.

~Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, CatBoost, and Random Forest models with a focus on minimizing missed attrition cases rather than accuracy.

~Selected Random Forest as the final model, achieving the lowest missed-risk rate (~16.9%) among evaluated models.

~Translated prediction probabilities into actionable risk segments, categorizing employees into high-risk (~8%), medium-risk (~51%), and low-risk (~41%) groups to support focused retention planning.

~Designed and HR-facing application that accepts new employee survey inputs and generates and generates the real-time attrition risk scores and risk buckets (high/medium/low) to support targeted interventions.

~Thresholds set:-
Low:- <35% 
Medium:- 35%-65%
High:- >65%
